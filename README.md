# pypractice-ab

This is a small hobby project to practice some of the languages and technologies I have some experience with already, but want to get a better grip on.

The idea is to make a small autobattler-style game. I will implement a basic version in Python to get more used to working with its classes. When the basic version is done, I will try and implement it as a web application so I can practice full stack development.
